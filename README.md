# Mockly

> Work in progress

Mockly is highly configurable mocking server focused on break the dependency between your Front End
applications and the HTTP services that they consume at development time. No more time wasted waiting
the server status or services availability. You will have your mocking server available in a breeze just
creating a few files, control how you want the services to behave applying delays or returning different
HTTP status codes.
